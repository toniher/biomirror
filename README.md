Scripts for mirroring biological data. They are periodically updated as source datasets are evolve.

First level subdirectories are arranged based on the storage/DB platform. Suitable config files are kept there.

Some of these scripts are used to support services such as:

* [GOGOApi](https://github.com/toniher/gogoapi). A web service for retrieving GO codes from sequence entries.
* [FA-nf](https://github.com/guigolab/FA-nf). A functional annotation Nextflow pipeline using some of the datasets retrieved thanks to these scripts.
